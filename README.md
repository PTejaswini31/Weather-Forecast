#Overview of Components#
#HTML Structure#

#The app starts with a simple HTML structure, featuring an input field for the location, a button to trigger the forecast retrieval, and a display area to show the weather forecast.#
#The user can input a location name, and on clicking the "Get Weather" button, the app shows a mocked forecast for that location.
CSS Styling#

#The app’s CSS is minimal and designed to provide a clean, modern look.#
#The #weatherApp div is styled with a blue background and white text, giving it a weather-themed aesthetic.#
#Input fields and buttons are styled with rounded corners and soft colors for a user-friendly, polished interface.#
#JavaScript Functionality#

#JavaScript powers the functionality. The getWeather() function takes the user’s input (location) and generates a mock forecast.#
Error handling is included to prompt the user if no location is entered.#
#The forecastDiv displays a simulated forecast for the current day and the next two days, keeping the app simple while showing the potential for a more complex forecast with an API.#
Mocked Data

For simplicity, the app doesn’t use a live API here but instead uses mocked data for illustrative purposes.
This design allows you to focus on the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration before expanding with additional functionality, such as real-time data from a weather API.
Potential for Expansion
To make the app more engaging and practical, consider adding the following features:

API Integration: Use a weather API like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI to fetch real-time data based on the user’s location input.
Geolocation Feature: Implement geolocation to fetch the weather for the user’s current location automatically.
Enhanced UI: Add icons or animations for different weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).
Temperature Units: Include options to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
Local Storage: Store past locations and allow users to view recent searches.
